Churn Prediction using ML – Future Interns Task 2
# FUTURE_ML_02 – Churn Prediction System

👩‍💻 **Internship:** Future Interns – Machine Learning Track  
📅 **Task:** 2 (Churn Prediction)  
🔍 **Goal:** Predict which customers are likely to leave a service

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Developed a classification model to analyze customer churn based on various factors such as tenure, services used, and monthly charges.

## 📂 Dataset
- Synthetic dataset: `churn_data.csv`
- Features include: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Tenure, Internet Service, Monthly Charges, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Preprocessed categorical features using Label Encoding
2. Split dataset into training and testing sets
3. Trained a Random Forest model
4. Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report
5. Visualized feature importance

## 📈 Results
- Visuals:
  - Confusion matrix of predictions
  - Top features contributing to churn
- Metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
